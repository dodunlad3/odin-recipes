        <strong><h2>Description</h2></strong>
        <p>This is a simple stovetop mac & cheese recipe.</p>
        <p>Fancy mac & cheese often costs $40 or even $50 because of all the expensive cheeses.</p>
        <p>This recipe is cheap and still very tasty!</p>

        <strong><h2>Ingredients</h2></strong>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (8 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>Ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <strong><h2>Directions</h2></strong>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>At the same time, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour in milk slowly, while stirring continuously. Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.</li>
            <li>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>        
            <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
            <p>You can never have enough cheese, and I usually add an extra 1/2 cup without ruining the recipe.</p>
            <p>Keep a careful eye on the milk when boiling, as milk boils fast and burns easily. Burnt milk will show up in the recipe's flavor if overcooked.</p>
        </ol>
